Correctly Cleaned Transcript
"student: would I need to cite this if im not directly taking any context from the episode: One final example that I want to include which is another example of his inability to maintain proper eye contact is right before the example I gave above when Lenoard and Sheldon first meet penny you can tell that there is some awkwardness as when leonard introduces himself and Sheldon to penny, Sheldon can be seen staring not directly into her eyes.
librarian: Great question. If you are referring to the episode you should cite it
student: so I would just do it as a quote or paraphrase then?
librarian: It is the same with anmy source you refer to in your assignment. You don't need to create an in-text citation but anything that you use/refer to, needs to be cited
librarian: If you are referring to something occuring in the episode, you can state that, like this:
librarian: As shown in episode 213, ""include the title of the episode"", Sheldon does not make eye contact when introduced to Penny. 
librarian: Does that make sense?
student: Yes
librarian: Are you using APA or MLA to cite?
student: APA
student: thankfully for my program behavioural sciences its all APA
student: so much easier
librarian: Okay, you can refer to the TV option in this link <a href=""https://library.senecapolytechnic.ca/c.php?g=718641&amp;p=5132108"" target=""_blank"">https://library.senecapolytechnic.ca/c.php?g=718641&amp;p=5132108</a>
librarian: If you are not quoting or paraphrasing conversation, you don't need an in-text citation. 
student: okay that makes more sense
librarian: If you want to include an in-text citation for the action occurring, you can use the paraphrase option. But that isn't really needed
librarian: If your professor has explicitly stated in the assignment to include in-text citation, I would use the paraphrase option
student: so as long as I don't take something from the text, either in quotes or paraphrase I don't need a citation?
librarian: Correct
student: Thanks again
librarian: No problem
librarian: Is there anything else I can help you with at this time?
student: That is all, I hope you have a great Monday
librarian: you too, thank you!
student: Take care
librarian: Feel free to come back if you have any more questions. You can also message us on Instagram @senecalibnlearn

"student: Checking on in-text citation of photographs in APA.
librarian: Hi there
student: Hi Lisa.
librarian: Are you askign about referring to an image, in an assignment? Or are you describing it? How are you using the image?
librarian: You would generally use the in-text citation of the source of the image
student: I am checking to advise a student. She did a PPT presentation and used an full citation for photos included on the slides. My understanding is that you use a short parenthetical citation (Thompson, 2020) for this.
librarian: For digital assignments there are no firm rules (yet) for APA
librarian: We offer guidance on this page <a href=""https://library.senecapolytechnic.ca/citingindigital?_gl=1*142plxr*_ga*MTg2MzYxOTMzMC4xNjk4MzI0NDg2*_ga_13FR5DF8TV*MTY5OTg4NDA4OS4xNi4xLjE2OTk4ODUxNTUuMC4wLjA"" target=""_blank"">https://library.senecapolytechnic.ca/citingindigital?_gl=1*142plxr*_ga*MTg2MzYxOTMzMC4xNjk4MzI0NDg2*_ga_13FR5DF8TV*MTY5OTg4NDA4OS4xNi4xLjE2OTk4ODUxNTUuMC4wLjA</a>.
librarian: But the general rule is that you would include the creator and the year in parenthesis
librarian: If there was no creator identified, they could use the shortened URL of the source of the image
librarian: We always instruct students to refer to the instruction from their professors, first, then use our Digital Assignments guidelines
librarian: Is there anything else I can help you with at this time?
librarian: Since I have not heard from you in a while, I will close this chat. Feel free to come back if you have any more questions. You can also message us on Instagram @senecalibnlearn

"student: Hello,
Could you please tell me where I can send an application to work in the library as librarian?
librarian: Hi there. 
librarian: External postings can be found in this link <a href=""https://www.senecacollege.ca/human-resources/careers.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.senecacollege.ca/human-resources/careers.html</a>
librarian: Is there anything else I can help you with at this time?
student: Thanks. It does not show that there are any librarian positions now. Could you please provide a contact number or email so that I can send my resume for future possible positions?
librarian: Unfortunately the application process is managed through our HR department, so I am unable to provide a direct email nor contact
librarian: Is there anything else I can help you with at this time?
student: Then could you please provide the number for HR?
student: Surely HR must have a number an applicant can reach out to?
librarian: The application process with Seneca Polytechnic does not work like that. The posting goes up and there is a process applicants need to follow to apply. If successful, the HR person assigned to that posting will contact the applicant
student: Ok thanks anyway
librarian: The general number is  

Phone: +1 416.491.5050

"student: I am working on an infographic
for a successfuly company.  How can I cite with APA for a company logo
librarian: Hi man - great question
student: Good morning Autumn
librarian: We have some examples for you to follow!
librarian: I will show you
student: ok thanks
librarian: APA and MLA publication manuals contain guidelines for citing your sources in research essays, not digital assignments like videos, infographics or Powerpoints.  So always check with your faculty on how they prefer these citations, as digital assignments don't require the use of standard APA and MLA format. 
librarian: <a href=""https://library.senecapolytechnic.ca/citingindigital/recommendations"" target=""_blank"">https://library.senecapolytechnic.ca/citingindigital/recommendations</a>
librarian: From the tab above - scroll down a tiny bit and click on the link/box for infographics
librarian: it includes an example of how to cite a photo which would be like a company logo 
student: Thank  you.  So I do not need to cite right below the image (if the image is put on the heading of the infographic).  I just need to cite under sources that is put at the bottom of the infographic ?
librarian: That is our Seneca recommendation yes - APA does not have a rule on this - so this is our way to give credit to your sources but not ruin the integrity of the infographic 
librarian: Feel free to check with your faculty regarding our Seneca recommendations 
student: For this inforgraphic, if I want to cite other sources (like a newspaper content or website content), should I also put the source of information under this section ""Sources"" ?
student: Is in cite citation not required for these text as well ?
librarian: I would still add in text citations if you are quoting or paraphrasing 
student: for those in text citation, I just follow the rules of APA ?
librarian: Yes
librarian: <p>List the title of the information in quotation marks (if title is not available, list a short description of the information, not in quotation marks), the source in brackets, and a hyperlink to the source at the end/bottom of the infographic in a section called Sources.</p><p>List them in the order they appear in the infographic. </p><p>List both images and other information sources together in the same Sources section.</p><p>If you are citing information from a journal article, use the name of the journal as the source, and include a permalink to the article. (<a href=""https://youtu.be/rdMG3DUV6hI"" target=""_blank"">How do I find the permalink to an article?</a>)</p>
student: for this website contents in infographic, I created another section called Reference List, or I put the citation reference under the section ""Sources"" also ?
librarian: As the example shows - we recommend adding all you sources under the source section of your infographic 
librarian: But that is a Seneca recommendation  - please consult your faculty to ensure they are finding our recommendation acceptable 
student: ok thank you
librarian: Glad to help - and I hope I did not confuse you more 
student: No, thank you.  I will try to follow the above suggestion.  Thank you'
librarian: Great
librarian: To find this link in the future - From our APA guide, <a href=""https://library.senecapolytechnic.ca/APA"" target=""_blank"">https://library.senecapolytechnic.ca/APA</a> hover your mouse over the citation examples tab. From the drop down click on 

Digital Assignments
student: Ok, I will keep this page and try to work on it.
student: thank you
librarian: Great - good luck on your infographic assignment 
student: thank you.  Have a good day
librarian: You as well!

student: No publication date right?
student: Should i write 2023?
student: bottom part : ""Copyright © 2023 Hofstede Insights Oy. All rights reserved.""
librarian: It doesn't look like this is a publication date, as that copyright date is for the whole website, and not necessarily the publication date. But in this case you could add an access date at the end. You can see an example of this here. on our When information is missing page of the MLA citation guide: <a href=""https://library.senecapolytechnic.ca/mla/missing_information#s-lib-ctab-16658558-1"" target=""_blank"">https://library.senecapolytechnic.ca/mla/missing_information#s-lib-ctab-16658558-1</a>

"student: Hello, how would I cite this website. It is for children's literature course. Please let me know. I have pasted the link here https://www.tokyvideo.com/video/finding-nemo-2003-5
librarian: good day Vanita<br />
student: Hello
librarian: Let me take a look.<br />
student: No worries
librarian: So if you simply want to cite the website, you can cite it as a website with a group author, and that would be Tokyvideo <li><a href=""https://library.senecapolytechnic.ca/apa/websites#s-lib-ctab-16145360-0"">Webpage/Article on a Website by a Group</a></li><br />
librarian: However, I suspect you are wanting to cite a portion/section of this video? Is that accurate?<br />
student: I just wanted to cite the website itself
student: Oh sorry the video
student: to reference it as a movie
student: I'm sorry about that
librarian: OK, then you do not need to inform the reader of your presentation about a particular TIME to watch the video?<br />
student: No it's not a particular time like not time stamping. I think then it would just be the website saying this is where I got the movie from
librarian: This citation example may be more fitting and provide your prof with more detailed information as to what part of the movie to watch to see what you are referencing. It saves them guessing or potentially having to watch a 90 minute movie. <li><a href=""https://library.senecapolytechnic.ca/apa/videos#s-lib-ctab-16145358-3"">Streaming Video from a Streaming Service (e.g., Netflix)</a></li><br />
student: Ahh yesss
librarian: OH, OK, well, if that's the case, then I would go back to the first example/link I sent you<br />
student: That
student: Sounds good
student: Thank you for your help
student: That's all for today :))
librarian: you're welcome Vanita. You can choose the best fit for your particular resource, from those two examples. Take care. Bye bye.<br />

"student: when using a direct quote through harvard referencing

student: the way they cite is kind of confusing for me
librarian: When I open that link, I see this specific image/video appearing larger than all the other results. Is this the specific one you are wanting to use? <a href=""https://hella-amberpricefield.tumblr.com/post/690868815601500160/finding-nemo-2003"" target=""_blank"">https://hella-amberpricefield.tumblr.com/post/690868815601500160/finding-nemo-2003</a><br />
librarian: oh for sure, citing images is confusing. You're absolutely right!<br />
student: yes that is correct I'm using the first gif where you can see nemo
librarian:  If you want to use an image by way of Google/Googling it: type in your search term/s, hit enter, then select IMAGES which is right below your search results. Then you will want to select TOOLS on the right below the search field, then select USAGE rights. then ""Creative Commons License"". Then you can select from any images that are displayed.
student: Yes I did that as well
librarian: I suggest this because it is somewhat of an easy image I THINK to locate, so I would ensure you locate one that is 'approved'<br />
librarian: OH, OK, great Sara.<br />
student: it didnt show u the google format of the image?
student: when u clicked the link?

student: oh myyy
student: Okay my question is how do I cite it from the google images
librarian: So click on that image to get to the page it is sitting on. I see it is from <b>hella-amberpricefield on Tumblr</b><br />
librarian: I would follow this example for citing an image from a website: <li><a href=""https://library.senecapolytechnic.ca/apa/images#s-lib-ctab-16412990-2"">Image from a Website</a></li><br />
student: Okay makes morre sense

librarian: Seneca Libraries has recommendations on how to cite images  you add to a digital assignment like a Powerpoint

student: Both
student: where can I find quotes?
student: either on ""How Covid 19 changed consumers shopping habits"" or ""how business can increase their revenue through social media""
librarian: so if you put a quote into the library homepage, there's a chance you'll get the source, if that quote was said in an article or ebook we have access to
librarian: hmm... ok just read your answer. those don't necessarily sound like quotes to me but instead they sound like research topics?
student: I don't have a quote but i need to find one related to my topic.
librarian: both of those are great topics and you'll be able to find lots of articles for each of those
librarian: let's start with the first one, with how covid changed shopping habits
librarian: So go to the library homepage: <a href=""https://library.senecapolytechnic.ca/"" target=""_blank"">https://library.senecapolytechnic.ca/</a>
student: the only thing is they have to be resent. 2022 until now
librarian: And type in shopping habits and covid
librarian: once you get your search results, you'll see on the left hand side of all the search results that you can put in some ""filters"" or ""rules"" about your search. one of them is publication date so you can change it so it's from a publication 2022 to 2023

librarian: For eBooks, you canfolow the guidelines in this link (uner the tab, eBooks) <a href=""https://library.senecapolytechnic.ca/apa/books"" target=""_blank"">https://library.senecapolytechnic.ca/apa/books</a>
librarian: I suggest following the same rules for 3-20 authors, which means listing them all
student: but the instruction is for print books. it doesnt say anything about having more than 3 authors in an ebook.
librarian: Exactly, that is why I suggest following it regardless
librarian: It is better to be able to explain your work and why you included them all (as per the book rules), then it would be to not include them and be penalized for it
student: okay. got it. 
thank you so much. i will just go through that.

librarian: Hi Allison<br />
librarian: Did you try dropping the title of the article into our front page search box?<br />
librarian: Where it says ""What would you like to find?""<br />
student: okay thank you so much I will try to do that
student: I didn't know I could do that before, thank you.
librarian: Absolutely! If that doesn't work there is one more trick - we can look for the title of the journal itself in the journal title finder and see if it shows up in one of our databases that is not indexed in the main search. So if you don't find it this way let me know!<br />
librarian: Any luck?<br />

"student: Hi, I want to use page numbers in my in  text citation from a book. but i am not quoting directly. im paraphrasing it. so using page number in citation afer paraphrasing.. will it be right or wrong?
librarian: hello there.<br />
student: hi
librarian: If you are only paraphrasing, you do not need to include page numbers.<br />
librarian: Are you citing APA or MLA?<br />
student: APA
student: as i will be paraphrasing a lot on different topics. will it be okay to use page numbers to be more specific?
librarian: The only thing I see about that on our Quoting VS Paraphrasing APA guide <a href=""https://library.senecapolytechnic.ca/apa/intext"" target=""_blank"">https://library.senecapolytechnic.ca/apa/intext</a>  is this: <b>
Note: Although not required, APA encourages including the page 
number(s) when paraphrasing long or complex sources, such as books, so 
that the reader can easily refer to the paraphrased information in your 
source. Always clarify with your instructor about their preference 
regarding page numbers in paraphrase in-text citations.

</b><br />
student: oh. very much specific answer. thank you so much.
librarian: You're very welcome. <br />
student: i appreciate your support.
librarian: Of course, anytime!<br />
librarian: Are you using one resource, but taking various information from it?<br />
librarian: or a variety of sources?<br />
student: one resource and various information.
librarian: ah, I see. There is a different way to do that. Let me find that for you, it is essentially putting the letters a, b, c. Give me a moment please to locate that<br />
student: okay sure
librarian: yessh, do you think I can find it quickly?! Nope, Still looking.<br />
student: haha. sure. take your time. 
justtore confirm my source is a book.
librarian: Here is a different university explaining it: <a href=""https://askus.library.wwu.edu/faq/116711"" target=""_blank"">https://askus.library.wwu.edu/faq/116711</a> Please review the third paragraph, starting with ""If on the other hand...""<br />
librarian: So, you only list that resource one time on your REFERENCE list page.<br />
librarian: but within the body of the paper, you need to cite in-text each time.<br />
student: got it. but it is about articles. and my source will be only one book. but i will be using multiple topics from the book,
librarian: WAIT! Oh my goodness. I am not correct Md Arafat!<br />
student: it is okay. take your time.
librarian: So really, all you want to do is get those citation in there in-text, throughout your paper, in such a way that each idea you take is cited.<br />
librarian: But if you are comfortable with asking your prof, and there is enough time to ask and wait for a response, by all means ask them if they would prefer that your in text para-phrasing include page numbers for their ease of locating the material you chose to paraphrase.<br />
librarian: Here are some tips for directly quoting, and how to incorporate those and have it flow nicely and succinctly: <a href=""https://www.alverno.edu/media/alvernocollege/library/pdfs/multiple7.pdf"" target=""_blank"">https://www.alverno.edu/media/alvernocollege/library/pdfs/multiple7.pdf</a><br />

librarian: In the case where the full citation has an author name, in this case, Spark, CBC Radio, use that in your in-text citation.

librarian: This way your citation will match with the one your teacher has given you.
librarian: You are very welcome.
student: (Spark CBC, 2020) or (Spark, CBC radio, 2020) ?

student: should there be a comma in between spark and cbc radio?
librarian: Yes.  I think you originally wrote Radio.
librarian: Yes.  If you are going to follow the format that your teacher created in the Reference List citation, and she put a comma, then you would put a comma as well.

"student: Hello, I am wrote this sentence how do i add the abbreviation of the name in APA --- Several factors contribute to the perpetuation of the nursing shortage. Notably, the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (2021) reported that one-third of registered nurses (RNs) who work directly with patients are 50 years of age or older and are close to retirement.
librarian: Hi Andrea<br />
student: Where do I add the abbreviation of RNAO
student: do i add it to the date like (RNAO, 2021) or do I do Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) (2021)
librarian: I think I would add it in brackets right after the name. It does look a little odd having the 2 sets of brackets together. let me check this. Just a minute.<br />
librarian: It does seem that 2 sets of brackets are allowed together with a space between them if they are unrelated items.<br />
librarian: That is true in this case.<br />
student: so what do you recommend i do
librarian: You would use the two sets of brackets with a space between them. 
Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) (2021)

<br />
student: ok thank you
librarian: Your welcome.<br />

"student: what is the citation
librarian: Are you using APA or MLA?<br />
librarian: I see you are using APA<br />
librarian: This is a document on a website<br />
